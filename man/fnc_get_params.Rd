\usage{
fnc_get_params(
  df.ids,
  tree_species = "spruce",
  df.ind.info = NULL,
  BW_or_D = "BW"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df.ids}{a data frame that contains at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{ID_custom} - a unique ID-column for assignment that all intermediate products as well as the output will be assigned to.
\item \code{easting} and \code{northing} - coordinates in UTM EPSG:32632
} \cr and may further contain the following meta information:
\itemize{
\item \code{slope} - slope at the modelling points in degree
\item \code{aspect} - aspect of the modelling points in degree
\item \code{coord_x} - longitude of points in degree, will be calculated automatically if missing
\item \code{coord_y} - latitude of points in degree, will be calculated automatically if missing
} \cr OR: A simple feature of type "POLYGON" with any of the columns above. If df.ids is a simple feature, site information "aspect" and "slope" will be averaged over the polygon area. Coord_y and coord_x will be taken from the centroid.}

\item{tree_species}{name of the tree species to be modelled with. Either a single species name that is then used for all points in \code{df.ids}, or a vector of the same length as \code{df.ids$ID} if the main tree species of each point is known and differs. Must be one of \code{beech}, \code{oak}, \code{spruce}, \code{pine}, \code{larch}, \code{douglasfir}. \cr It is  recommended (findings of project WHH-KW) to use the settings of spruce for fir and the settings of pine for larch. If certain tree specific parameters should be changed permanently, the corresponding object \code{params_...} should be overwritten manually before running the function.}

\item{df.ind.info}{a data frame containing individual site information for each ID or if parameters are presumed to be different than the default settings of \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{set_paramLWFB90}}. They need to be given here in the form of a data frame containing the column \code{ID_custom}, which should be identical to the \code{ID_custom}-column of\code{df.ids}, and additional columns that are named exactly like the parameters in \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{set_paramLWFB90}}.}

\item{wuchsmaechtigkeit}{function in progress. provides an approximation for the mean growth of an area in BW. Adjusts LAI, SAI and max height of the vegetation. Default is \code{F}, as still in progress.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of parameter settings that can be read and further processed by \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_multisite_LWFB90}} or \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_LWFB90}}
}
\description{
This function creates a list of parameter settings. Vegetation settings, by default, represent the findings of the WHH-KW project.
