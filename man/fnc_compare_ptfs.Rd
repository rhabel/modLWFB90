\arguments{
\item{df.ids}{a data frame containing the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{ID_custom} - a unique ID-column for assignment that all intermediate products as well as the output will be assigned to
\item \code{easting} and \code{northing} - coordinates in UTM EPSG:32632
}}

\item{testgebiet}{at the current stage of development, we're working with test areas that have to be named here as \code{BDS} for Bodensee/07b, or \code{NPS} for National Park Schwarzwald. Eventually, this should be replaced by a BW-wide option. This parameter might be useful if a spatial pre-selection should be included for performance optimization...}

\item{what_to_test}{sets the main selection, whether soil data or PTF behaviour should be investigated. \cr Must be one of \code{SOILDATA} or \code{PTFs}.}

\item{MvG_own_vals}{if \code{what_to_test} is \code{SOILDATA} and \code{soiloption_to_test} includes \code{OWN}: \cr will MvG parameters be provided (i.e. from lab analyses) or shall the PTF in \code{PTF_to_use} also be applied to the soil data in \code{df.soils}}

\item{PTF_to_use}{which PTF should be applied for creating hydraulic information from soil data in \code{soiloption_to_test}. Must be one of \code{HYPRES}, \code{PTFPUH2}, or \code{WESSOLEK}.}

\item{PTF_to_test}{if \code{what_to_test} is \code{PTFs}: \cr which PTFs should be compared. Must be any combination of \code{HYPRES}, \code{PTFPUH2}, or \code{WESSOLEK} and can include \code{OWN_PARMS} if own MvG parameters are given in \code{df.soils}}

\item{soiloption_to_use}{which soil data should the PTFs in \code{PTF_to_test} be applied to. Must be one of \code{STOK}, \code{BZE}, or \code{OWN} if data is supplied at \code{df.soils}}

\item{limit_MvG}{should the hydraulic parameters limited to "reasonable" ranges as described in \code{\link{fnc_limit}}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{df.soils}{if \code{OWN} is selected in \code{soiloptions_to_test}, or \code{OWN_PARMS}  is selected in \code{PTF_to_test}, these information must be provided here as a dataframe that contains the following columns:\cr
\itemize{
\item \code{ID_custom} - a unique custom ID matching the ID_custom of df.ids
\item \code{mat} - number of soil layer starting with 1 counting upwards
\item \code{upper} and \code{lower} - upper and lower boundaries of soil layers in cm
\item \code{humus} - thickness of the humuslayer in m
}
Caution: \cr If PTFs are to be applied here, the columns \code{sand, silt, clay, oc.pct} in \%, and \code{bd} in g m-1 must be provided. \cr Else, if \code{PTF_to_test} includes \code{OWN_PARMS}, the following columns must be provided NA-free: \code{ths, thr, alpha, npar, mpar, ksat}, and \code{tort}.}

\item{output_path}{path to the folder where images shall be printed to}

\item{bze_buffer}{whether buffer should be used in extracting points from BZE raster files if \code{NAs} occur in {m}, default is \code{NA}}

\item{depth_to_test}{the depth in which comparisons should be made in m negative downwards from the surface. Default is \code{c(-0.15, -0.30, -0.60)}.}

\item{soiloption_to_test}{if \code{what_to_test} is \code{SOILDATA}: \cr which datasets should be compared. At least two of \code{STOK}, \code{BZE}, or \code{OWN} if own soil data is available.}
}
\value{
Returns one image for each ID in df.ids, showing water retention and conductivity curves if \code{PTFs} are investigated. If soil data is compared, soil texture triangle, bd, oc.pct and gravel are also shown.
}
\description{
This function enables the user to visually compare modelling options. As the soil input is likely to be very influencial for the model's output, this is also a reason to check for potentially confusing results.

The two main options are comparing the soil data itself, and comparing what the PTFs do with the data at hand.
