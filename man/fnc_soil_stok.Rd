\usage{
fnc_soil_stok(
  df,
  df.LEIT,
  PTF_to_use,
  limit_bodtief,
  parallel_processing = F,
  maxcores = parallel::detectCores() - 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the columns \code{ID} and \code{ID_custom} as distinct assignment from the initial \code{df.ids} dataframe and the column \code{RST_F}, which is created in \code{\link{fnc_get_soil}} through a spatial join of the coordinates with the STOK-BW shapefile (or, at this stage, the shapefile of test areas).}

\item{df.LEIT}{a data frame containing LEITPROFILE. At this stage of development, the comprehensive BW-wide database is not complete yet, so the test area needs to be assigned here. However, this is done automatically in  \code{\link{fnc_get_soil}}.}

\item{PTF_to_use}{which PTF will later be used in \code{\link{fnc_get_soil}} has an impact on the setting of oc.pct, so this information is passed down from \code{\link{fnc_get_soil}} here.}

\item{limit_bodtief}{max soil depth, default is \code{NA} and uses max soil depth as defined in \code{df.LEIT}. If not \code{NA} soil-dfs are created down to the depth specified here as depth in \code{m}, negative. Might be used to give room for different \code{maxrootdepth} - settings in \link{fnc_get_params}. In this case, soil depth may be reduced significantly.}

\item{parallel_processing}{shall the process be run parallely}

\item{maxcores}{if \code{parallel_processing = T}, on how many cores shall the process be run parallely}
}
\value{
Returns a list of soil data frames.
}
\description{
This function transforms data as currently stored in the LEITPROFIL-database and returns a list of soil data frames as recognised by \code{LWFBrook90R}. The list is further processed in \code{\link{fnc_get_soil}} by adding soil hydraulic information, humus, and fine roots and can then be read by \code{\link[LWFBrook90]{run_multisite_LWFB90}}.
