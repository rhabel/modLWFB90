\title{Function to aggregate and write data from automated LWFB90-Runs}
\usage{
fnc_write_agg_depr(
  x,
  aggr_tp,
  col_select_day = NA,
  col_select_mon = NA,
  col_select_vp = NA,
  col_select_yr = NA,
  dir_name = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{one of the intermediate producs of \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_LWFB90}} or  \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_multisite_LWFB90}}, which is further processed internally. Can't be adjusted.}

\item{aggr_tp}{a string containing the desired aggregation time period. Can be \code{daily},  \code{monthly}, \code{vegper}, \code{yearly}, or any combination of the four (i.e. \code{monthly_vegper}). The latter does all terms that are detectable within the string.}

\item{col_select_day}{a string containing the desired columns from the daily-aggregation (see details)}

\item{col_select_mon}{a string containing the desired columns from the monthly-aggregation (see details)}

\item{col_select_vp}{a string containing the desired columns from the vegperiod-aggregation (see details)}

\item{col_select_yr}{a string containing the desired columns from the yearly-aggregation (see details)}

\item{dir_name}{directory for tmp files, if \code{NA} as in default, results are returned to console}
}
\value{
Returns the desired output to .rds files
}
\description{
LWFBrook90 creates a lot of output files. In order to keep data storage to a minimum, both \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_LWFB90}} and \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_multisite_LWFB90}} provide an \code{output_fun} - argument that can be used to reduce the output and directly write it to a database. This is what this function is made for. \cr In comparison to \code{\link{fnc_write}}, which only reduces the columns returned by \code{\link[LWFBrook90R]{run_LWFB90}} (see help page), this function enables aggregation over vegperiod and monthly, plus a more detailed selection of drought indices. See detail section.\cr\cr IMPORTANT: FOR RUNNING THIS AGGREGATE FUNCTION, \code{output} in \code{run_multiside_LWFB90} MUST BE SET TO A \code{df.output} AS SET BY THE CODE IN THE EXAMPLE SECTION \cr The function writes .rds files with the desired output for each point. \code{\link{fnc_write_to_sql}} can be used to convert these files into a SQLite-DB. This "step-in-between" is necessary because SQLite does not support parallel writing.

\section{Output column selection}{

IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE A SUBSELECTION, OR THERE WILL BE A LOT (>100) OF COLUMNS.
For a complete list of possible output types plus description, see \code{"U:/db_brook90_output/whh_db_documentation"}

# setting for df.output:
df.output <- set_outputLWFB90()
df.output[,] <- 0L
df.output[c("Abov", "Evap", "Flow", "Swat"), c("Day")] <- 1
